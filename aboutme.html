           <p>Hi, I am Aditya Gupta a second year undergraduate student at IIT GUWAHATI pursuing Mathematics and Computing. I have a knack of programming, problem solving and a keen interest in mathematics and a habit of analysing various problems. My life runs on the motto "rise,awake and stop not till the goal is reached". I always live in a constant pursuit of achieng my ambitions and toil endlessly to do so. Being born in a humble background I know the importance of working hard and the significance of all the opportuinites that come in life.
            Apart from all this I am a foodie and a have deep interest in chess.
